**Data Exploration:**
- **Visualized Trends:** We started by examining the historical data to identify any underlying patterns or trends over time. This included plotting the overall trend to understand the direction and magnitude of changes in the data.
- **Individual Price Components:** We also focused on specific components such as the Closing price, High price, Low price, and Volume. Visualizing these individual components helped us understand the behavior of different aspects of the data.

**Transformation:**
- **Box-Cox Transformation:** To make the data more suitable for modeling, we applied the Box-Cox transformation. This technique helps in stabilizing the variance and making the data more stationary, which is crucial for time series analysis. Stationarity means that the statistical properties of the data (mean, variance) remain constant over time.

**Model Selection:**
- **Compared Auto-ARIMA and Manual ARIMA Models:** We evaluated both automated and manual approaches to ARIMA modeling.
  - **Auto-ARIMA:** This algorithm automatically selects the best parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model by optimizing certain criteria.
  - **Manual ARIMA:** We also experimented with different sets of parameters manually. After extensive testing, we found that the ARIMA model with parameters (5, 1, 1) combined with the Box-Cox transformation provided the best performance.

**Forecasting:**
- **100-Day Forecasts Using ARIMA and ETS Models:** We generated forecasts for the next 100 days using the selected ARIMA model (5, 1, 1 with Box-Cox transformation) and compared it with forecasts generated by the ETS (Exponential Smoothing State Space) model. ETS is another time series forecasting method that accounts for error, trend, and seasonality components.

**Comparison:**
- **Visualized Actual Data vs. All Forecasts:** To assess the performance of our models, we visualized the actual data against the forecasts from both the ARIMA and ETS models. This comparison helped us evaluate how well each model was able to capture the patterns in the data and predict future values. Visualizing these results side by side provided a clear picture of each model's accuracy and reliability in forecasting.
